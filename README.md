My Résumé, written in LaTeX

This uses the [Friggeri CV Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/friggeri-cv-template/hmnchbfmjgqh#.VzRFzFelQkM) as found on Overleaf.
I have modified the class file to use Helvetica Neue and use my name in the PDF metadata.


This requires XeLaTeX and the Helvetica Neue family of fonts. Compiles on Tex Live 2015 on OS X.
