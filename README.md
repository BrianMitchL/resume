My Résumé, written in LaTeX.

This uses a modified version of the [Friggeri CV Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/friggeri-cv-template/hmnchbfmjgqh#.VzRFzFelQkM) as found on Overleaf.

This compiles with XeLaTeX, and uses the SF Pro Text and Dank Mono font families (not included in this repo due to licensing).
