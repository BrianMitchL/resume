My Résumé, written in LaTeX

This uses the [Friggeri CV Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/friggeri-cv-template/hmnchbfmjgqh#.VzRFzFelQkM) as found on Overleaf.
I have modified the class file to use Helvetica Neue and use my name in the PDF metadata.


This requires XeLaTeX and the Helvetica Neue family of fonts as well as fontawesome installed as a system font. I used
```shell
brew tap caskroom/fonts
brew cask install font-fontawesome
```
Compiles on the latest version of Tex Live on the latest version of macOS.
